# About
LazyRedTeamer is a collection of my own tools that I use to automate setting up infrastructure, recon, explotiations and post-exploitation. 

# install
`git pull <repo>`


`export PATH="<path to the repo>/LazyRedTeamer/bin:$PATH"`

check by running `lazytest` it runs `whoami`, so you should see your username
